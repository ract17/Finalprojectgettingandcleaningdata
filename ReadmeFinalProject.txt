The first step was to activate the dplyr package.

Step 2 was to download the dataset and set the working directory

Step 3 was to assign all the data frames using read.table() function

Step 4 was to merge the datasets using the rbind functions

Step 5 was to extract the measurements requested. For this step I used dplyr functions as select() and contains()

Step 6 was the labeling of the variables, using the function names()

Finally it was created a txt. file named FinalData with data tidy.
